## Story

A mysterious forest on the outskirts of humanity greets the sun as it does every day. However, you, a young kitten, are a new addition to the woods, unsure of where you are or how to get home. As you wander through the twists and turns of this unfamiliar place, you discover that there is more to the strange energy of it than meets the eye.


## Three Levels

Play each level to experience a unique atmosphere and gain a new ability. There are a total of three levelsâ€”bird, turtle, and fox.
